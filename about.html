                Assisting primary school children in the LittleCooks class run each week after school at Bayfield School (and a one-off at Freemans Bay School). This involves setting up equipment, helping the kids get ready and helping the group read through the recipe step by step before the class begins. I then help the kids where necessary to cook the recipe of the week and have fun while keeping the kids safe. At the end I do the dishes and clean up.<br><br>
